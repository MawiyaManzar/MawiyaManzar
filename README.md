Hey, I'm Mawiya Manzar! 
I'm an aspiring AI engineer passionate about building intelligent, user-focused solutions that make a difference. I love diving into projects that blend creativity with code, whether it's crafting chatbots, designing recommendation systems, or exploring the latest in AI and ML. My journey is all about learning, experimenting, and sharing my progress.
🛠️ What I Do

AI & ML: Building conversational AI, recommendation engines, and data-driven apps using tools like LangChain, Pydantic, and Google's Gemini.
Web Development: Creating intuitive interfaces with Flask, Streamlit, and React, often paired with backends on Supabase or Render.
Projects: From AmiConnect, a student connection platform, to WakeelSahab, a legal research tool, I focus on real-world impact.
Learning: Currently deep into Krish Naik’s Data Science bootcamp and CampusX’s Deep Learning series to level up my skills.
